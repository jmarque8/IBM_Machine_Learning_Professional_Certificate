This repository is related to the __final assigments__ done during the IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate. 
THe certificate consists on __six courses__ and at the end of each one the instructors ask to write a __report__ rather than present the code about one (or more) a model(s) learned during the course.

The finished reports are:

 1) C01, Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning. (Final_assigment_C01_EDA_for_machine_learning.pdf)
 2) C02, Supervised Learning - Regression (final_assigment_c02_supervised_learning_regression.pdf)
 3) C03, Supewrvised Learning - Classification (final_assigment_c03_supervised_learning_classification.pdf)
 4) C04, Unsupervised Learning (final_assigmnet_c04_unsupervised_learning.pdf)
 5) C05, Deep Learning and Reinforcement (final_assignment_C05_deep_learning.pdf)
 6) C06, Specialized Models: Time Series and Survival Analysis (Final_assignment_C06_Time_Series.pdf)
