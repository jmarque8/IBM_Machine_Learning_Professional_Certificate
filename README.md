This repository is related to the final assigments done during the IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate. 
THe certificate consists on six courses and at the end of each one the instructors ask to write a report rather than present the code about one (or more) a model(s) learned during the course.

 1) C01, Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning. (Final_assigment_C01_EDA_for_machine_learning.pdf)
 2) C02, Supervised Learning - Regression (final_assigment_c02_supervised_learning_regression.pdf)
 3) C03, Supewrvised Learning - Classification (final_assigment_c03_supervised_learning_classification.pdf)
 4) C04, Unsupervised Learning (final_assigmnet_c04_unsupervised_learning.pdf)
